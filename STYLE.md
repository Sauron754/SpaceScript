We use PEP8 style guiding with a couple exceptions/specifications:

variable names: camelCase
function names: underline
method names: underline
class names: camelCase
global variables(only allowed inside one module): _camelCase

We have decided to specify the variable type after the variable(appendix), for better readability:

_int = integer
_float = float
_str = string
_bool = boolean
_char = character
_obj = object
