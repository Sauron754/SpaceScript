This file explains the communication template of the threads

1 Queues
	1.1 Main-Com(MC) Queue [
		can be passed to multiple threads is used by the threads to give/take commands to/from the main module
		e.g. restartTerminal(), accelerate()
	]
	1.2 Inter-Thread(IT) Queue[
		used to comunicate between threads; there can be more instances of IT Queues
	]

2 Pipes
	1.1 Main-Thread(MT) Pipe [
		same as Main-Com Queue; with the only difference of the restriction to two-way communication
	]
	1.2 Thread-Thread(TT) Pipe [
		used to link two threads together
	]

3 Arrays
	3.1 Hold-Value(H-Value) [
		every thread is required to have a H-Value, because it is essential for communication timing; the H-Value is a boolean
	]
